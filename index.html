    <h2>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</h2>
    <p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.  But why did this happen?  Wouldn’t you think a fox, regardless of how quick he might be, would choose to run away from the dog?  Foxes don’t strike me as the type of animals to taunt other animals – especially predatory creatures capable of killing them.  I understand that foxes don’t have the mental capacity or reasoning ability of humans, but certainly they possess enough sense to flee from a potentially dangerous situation before disaster strikes.</p>
